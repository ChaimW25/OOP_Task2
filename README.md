## Elevator problem - offline algorithm

In this task, the challenge will focus on the offline version of the smart elevator problem encountered in the first task. This means that all the readings are given to us in advance, and our only requirement is to allocate each reading in an efficient manner, minimizing the waiting time for elevators. Specifically, this task emphasizes the challenge of assigning a "call" to the elevator.
