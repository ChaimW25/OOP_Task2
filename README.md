# Ex1 - OOP COURSE 


## Elevator problem - offline algorithm

In this task the challenge will focus on the offline version of the smart elevator problem that we encounter in the first task - meaning all the readings are given to us in advance, and we are only required to embed each reading in a benevolent manner (so that the rule of waiting for elevators is reduced to a minimum). 
In fact, the current task focuses mainly on the challenge of assigning a "call" to the elevator.
